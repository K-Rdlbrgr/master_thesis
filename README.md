This repository contains all and solely the code for our blockchain-based online voting application Votechain.
Votechain allows you to hold elections in a secure, anonymous and fully transparent manner leveraging blockchain technology. 
Technically, every casted vote means an additional block on the blockchain, encrypted with SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm. It contains the voter's choice, hash and previous hash, the nonce and a timestamp. The election administrators are not able to see individual voter's choices since blocks can only be decrypted with the associated Voter Key (Private Key). The only person who temporarily gets access to this Key is the respective voter.
The Frontend consists of two main parts. First, the voting page which allows voters to select a candidate and confirm their choice. Second, the verification page, which provides the user with the aforementioned individual Voter Key (Private Key). It enables users to verify their vote afterwards. The database does not store Voter Keys manifesting the system's autonomous and anonoymous character.
